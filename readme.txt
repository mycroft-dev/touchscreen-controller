Several drivers are archived here for Focaltech FT6336G touch controller used
on the Mark2 Microtips LCD display.  Some drivers seem quite different
than others so multiple are kept here for consideration. Also many drivers
support a range of devices, i.e. the 5x06 driver supports the 63x6 parts too.
